Hey, Iâ€™m Lukas :)

I'm a software engineer from Austria. Interested in many things. Including
science, sustainability and visions. And I try to blog about stuff such as that.

# What's a **Buddelkiste**?

I'm pretty sure you're familiar with a *sandbox*. Well, a *Buddelkiste* is a
synonym for *Sandkasten*, which is German for *sandbox*. So, there you have it.
It's my very personal sandbox to dig and construct probably pointless stuff.
